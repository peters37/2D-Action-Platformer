Thanks for checking out my game!

Your goal is to navigate through four different environments, where the last one is a challenging boss fight.
Some rooms will require you to jump across platforms and follow the arrows.
Other rooms require you to defeat enemies before you can move on.

The controls are simple.
Use the arrow keys to move the character.
Use the space bar to jump.
Use right shift to swing your sword.
